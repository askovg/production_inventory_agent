We found our database on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis

We improve it by adding some realistics variables (generate by AI):
1. Time and Identity Variables
inventory_id: A unique numerical identifier for each specific record in the time series.

date: The specific calendar date for each entry, spanning a 90-day historical period.

2. Dynamic Inventory Flow Variables
daily_sold_units: The quantity of products actually sold on that specific day, simulated using a Poisson distribution.

daily_production_units: The quantity of new stock added to the inventory on a given day, triggered by automated replenishment logic.

current_stock_level: The real-time inventory balance at the end of the day, calculated as: Previous Stock + Production - Sales.

3. Environmental & Contextual Variables
temp_celsius: The recorded daily temperature (in Celsius) associated with the product's location.

weather_condition: A categorical variable describing the atmospheric conditions (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Stormy).

promotion_active: A binary flag (0 or 1) indicating whether a marketing promotion or discount was active on that date.

4. Performance & Financial Indicators (KPIs)
daily_holding_cost: The calculated financial cost of storing the remaining units for that day, based on the product's unit price.

is_stockout: A binary indicator that switches to 1 whenever the current_stock_level reaches zero.

Also we used a python code to retrieve the final database.
